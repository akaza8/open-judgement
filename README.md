# OpenJudgement

OpenJudgement is an open-source, anonymous public dispute platform designed around
structured debates, evidence submission, and community verdicts.

The system uses a strict case lifecycle, role-based permissions, and scoped anonymity
to enable high-engagement public judgment without identity leakage.

> This platform is not therapy, legal advice, or counseling.
